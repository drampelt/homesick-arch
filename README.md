homesick-arch
=============

Dotfiles/configuration I use for arch, managed with [technicalpickles/homesick](https://github.com/technicalpickles/homesick)

Contains configuration for:
- i3
- [i3blocks](https://github.com/vivien/i3blocks)
- terminator
- x (xinitrc)

Requirements:
- Obviously all things that it contains configuration for
- mpd
- [spark(lines)](https://github.com/holman/spark)
- fonts (FontAwesome, Emoji, and a powerline font although right now only FontAwesome is used)
- mpc
- amixer
- shutter
 
Heavily inspired by [mrkernalpanic/archbookpro](https://github.com/mrkernalpanic/archbook-pro), [ninetyfourbit/dotfiles](https://github.com/ninetyfourbit/dotfiles) and with some scripts from [the i3blocks wiki](https://github.com/vivien/i3blocks/wiki/Blocklets)
